The goal of Modheim is to allow quick and easy demployments of modpacks for Valheim. 

Ever had that sitaution of wanting a friend to play with you but they need to download a bunch of mods? Like 26 mods and spend over an hour configuring them all? No more! Just build your modpack in Modheim and send them the modpack. Modheim will take the pack and apply all of the same mods and configurations you did, all with the push of a button. 

Users can also change between mod profiles at the touch of a button, allowing them to change the game's modded setup to suit their needs, be it for playing on different servers or playing solo. 

By design, Modheim functions similarly to Minecraft Forge and MultiMC. Modpacks do not contain a list of mods, but rather the mods and their configurations themselves in a compressable format for Modheim to extract into the game.
