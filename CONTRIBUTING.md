We welcome pull requests from everyone. By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by the Modheim [code of conduct]. You also agree that by submitting a pull request for this project, **[your contribution will be licensed under the MIT license for this project][modheim license]**.

Note: For large changes or added features, please open an Issue indicating what you are intended to work on. This is to allow greater collaboration and prevent multiple isolated indivduals accidentially working on the same thing.

1. Fork and clone the Modheim repo (see [fork a repo] )
2. Switch to the develop branch.
3. Make your change. Add tests and/or demo scenes for your change. 
4. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

We will try to give initial feedback to pull requests within a few days. However, this may not always be possible. Please be patient, we will look at every pull request as soon as we can.

Your pull request will have a better chance of being accepted if you do the following: 

* Send one pull request for each new feature. It's time consuming for us to review multi-feature changes.
* Write tests for each change / new feature (not always possible)
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
* Target and make changes against the develop branch.
